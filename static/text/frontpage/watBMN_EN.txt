The Bèta Music Night (BMN) is a yearly recurring concert, organised by the study association
A–Eskwadraat's committee with the same name. The first edition was in 2013, and we have had
nine editions since. The Bèta Music Night has grown to be one of A–Eskwadraat's biggest
activities. We are already very busy with the organisation of the eleventh edition.

The BMN brings A–Eskwadraat's best musicians together. This year we will once again get a
group of around thirty participants together. The setlist consists of covers of famous, and
not so famous songs. Each song has a different line-up with no two songs having the exact same
group of musicians on stage. This way the musicians learn to play together with a lot of
different people resulting in some nifty band experience. It is very nice to see that we, as
real bèta association, can show a different side of ourselves.
